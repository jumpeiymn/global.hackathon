Hello, our team consist of Japanese,Canadian,Thai,Chinese,and Korian in Tokyo,Japan.Our team name is called Gundam because we like ガンダム！Gundam/ガンダム is a Japanese giant robot mecha anime series and is very popular.

Although there is an explosion in the popularity of computer science in the United States, computer science and engineering is still looked down upon in Japan.Engineer is not popular job in Japan.
But we want to change this situation.
We are thinking that ENGINEER makes the world better for the future and Japanese engineers should contribute to do that.
If we win,we can express Japanese potential of coding, computer science and Hackathons to the world.

私たちは、日本人、カナダ人、タイ人、中国人、韓国人のグローバルチームです。アメリカでは情報工学が人気のある学業であるのに対し、
日本ではまだコンピュータサイエンスの分野は人気が高くはありません。私たちはこの現状を変えたいと考えています。
もし、Global hackathonで勝つことができれば、日本の若い世代にコンピュータサイエンスの魅力を伝えることができると考えています。
